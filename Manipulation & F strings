================================================
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x weeks left.

code-
age = input(15)
weeks = (90-int(age)) * 52
print(weeks)

output -3900
================================================
a = int("5") / int(2.7)
int("5") = 5
int(2.7) = 2
a = 5/2 = 2.5 = float
===============================================

input-
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
a = input("What was the total bill? $") 
d = input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?")
b = input("How many people to spilt the bill?")
e = (float(d) * 0.01) * float(100)
f = e+float(a)
g = round(f/float(b),2)
print(f"Each person should pay :$ {g}")

output-
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $100
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill?2
Each person should pay: $56.00
